# Monitoring

An interface build as a web app that can be accessed by any common browser is provided to manage experimental results. No additional requirements apart from those in `requirements.txt` are necessary as the interface runs within a Python Flask backend. 

To start the local server you need to run the following command in any terminal from inside the root directory:

```
sh ./monitor
```

You should now be able to access the interface by entering `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser. The flask process should
also give you the link in the terminal.
